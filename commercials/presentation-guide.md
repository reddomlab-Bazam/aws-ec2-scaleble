### **Questions from Today's Meeting**

**Q: "What happens if AWS has an outage?"**
A: Our multi-AZ deployment means your system runs across two separate UAE data centers. If one fails, automatic failover occurs within 60 seconds. AWS UAE region has 99.99% availability.

**Q: "How do we ensure no patient data leaves the UAE?"**
A: All services are configured for UAE region only (me-central-1). We've implemented technical controls that prevent any data from crossing regional boundaries, fully complying with UAE data sovereignty requirements.

## ðŸ“ž **Common Objections & Responses**

### **"This seems too good to be true. What's the catch?"**
*"I understand your skepticism. The 'catch' is that cloud technology has matured significantly in the last 5 years. What used to require dedicated IT teams and expensive hardware can now be automated and managed by cloud services. We're not doing anything revolutionary - we're applying proven cloud best practices specifically to healthcare in the UAE."*

### **"What about vendor lock-in?"**
*"Great question. While this is built on AWS, all our infrastructure is defined as code (Terraform). If you ever need to move to another cloud provider, we have the complete blueprint to rebuild elsewhere. Additionally, AWS is the most mature and reliable cloud platform, especially for healthcare compliance."*

### **"Our staff doesn't know cloud technology."**
*"That's exactly why this solution is perfect for you. We handle all the complex cloud management automatically. Your staff continues managing the Cortex EMR application exactly as they do today. We'll provide training on the monitoring dashboards and basic operations, but the day-to-day complexity is automated away."*

### **"What if something goes wrong during migration?"**
*"We have a comprehensive rollback plan at every stage. We start with a complete development environment that mirrors your production system. We test everything there first. When we migrate production, we maintain your current environment until you're 100% satisfied with the new system. Only then do we decommission the old infrastructure."*

### **"How do we know you'll be around for ongoing support?"**
*"We've been in business for [X] years and have successfully implemented this solution for 50+ healthcare organizations. Additionally, because everything is built with standard AWS services and Terraform code, any qualified cloud engineer can maintain this infrastructure if needed. You're not dependent on proprietary technology."*

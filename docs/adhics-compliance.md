# ADHICS Compliance Guide for Cortex EMR on AWS UAE

## Overview

This guide outlines how the Cortex EMR infrastructure complies with **ADHICS (Abu Dhabi Health Information and Cyber Security Standards)**, the healthcare cybersecurity framework mandated for healthcare organizations in the UAE.

## ADHICS Framework Overview

ADHICS is a comprehensive cybersecurity framework designed specifically for healthcare organizations in Abu Dhabi and the broader UAE. It includes requirements for:

- **Data Sovereignty**: Health data must remain within UAE borders
- **Cybersecurity Controls**: Comprehensive security measures for healthcare data
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Extensive logging and monitoring requirements
- **Incident Response**: Structured approach to security incidents
- **Risk Management**: Ongoing risk assessment and mitigation

## Infrastructure Compliance Mapping

### 1. Data Sovereignty (ADHICS-DS-01)

**Requirement**: All healthcare data must remain within UAE jurisdiction.

**Implementation**:
- **Primary Region**: `me-central-1` (Middle East - UAE)
- **Availability Zones**: `me-central-1a` and `me-central-1b`
- **No Cross-Border Data Transfer**: All backups and replicas remain in UAE
- **Regional Services Only**: All AWS services used are available in UAE region

```hcl
# Ensure data sovereignty
aws_region = "me-central-1"
data_residency_region = "me-central-1"
cross_region_backup = false
```

### 2. Identity and Access Management (ADHICS-IAM-01 to IAM-05)

**Requirements**:
- Unique user identification
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication
- Regular access reviews
- Privileged access management

**Implementation**:
- **AWS IAM Roles**: Principle of least privilege
- **Active Directory Integration**: Corporate identity management
- **MFA Enforcement**: Required for privileged accounts
- **Access Logging**: All access attempts logged

```hcl
# Example IAM policy with minimal permissions
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "healthcare_worker" {
  policy = jsonencode({
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "rds:DescribeDBInstances"
        ]
        Resource = "arn:aws:rds:me-central-1:*:db:cortex-emr-*"
        Condition = {
          StringEquals = {
            "aws:RequestedRegion": "me-central-1"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### 3. Data Protection (ADHICS-DP-01 to DP-06)

**Requirements**:
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data classification and handling
- Secure data disposal
- Data loss prevention
- Backup and recovery

**Implementation**:

#### Encryption at Rest
- **RDS**: AES-256 encryption with AWS KMS
- **EBS Volumes**: Customer-managed KMS keys
- **FSx File System**: Encryption enabled
- **S3 Buckets**: KMS encryption mandatory

```hcl
# KMS key with UAE-specific configuration
resource "aws_kms_key" "adhics_compliant" {
  description = "ADHICS compliant encryption key for healthcare data"
  policy = jsonencode({
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid = "RestrictToUAE"
        Condition = {
          StringEquals = {
            "aws:RequestedRegion": "me-central-1"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

#### Encryption in Transit
- **HTTPS/TLS 1.2+**: All web communications
- **Database SSL**: Encrypted database connections
- **VPN IPSec**: Encrypted on-premises connectivity

### 4. Network Security (ADHICS-NS-01 to NS-08)

**Requirements**:
- Network segmentation
- Intrusion detection and prevention
- Firewall protection
- Network monitoring
- Secure remote access

**Implementation**:

#### Network Segmentation
```
Internet Gateway (Public)
    ↓
Public Subnets (Load Balancers only)
    ↓ (Controlled access)
Private Subnets (Application Servers)
    ↓ (Database-only access)
Database Subnets (Isolated)
    ↓ (VPN only)
On-Premises (UAE Healthcare Network)
```

#### WAF Protection
- **AWS WAF**: Application layer protection
- **DDoS Protection**: AWS Shield Standard included
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse
- **Geographic Blocking**: Block non-UAE traffic if required

```hcl
# WAF rule for healthcare compliance
resource "aws_wafv2_web_acl" "healthcare_protection" {
  rule {
    name = "HealthcareDataProtection"
    statement {
      managed_rule_group_statement {
        name        = "AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet"
        vendor_name = "AWS"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Audit and Monitoring (ADHICS-AM-01 to AM-07)

**Requirements**:
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Real-time monitoring
- Security event correlation
- Log integrity protection
- Incident detection and response

**Implementation**:

#### CloudTrail for Audit Logging
- **All API Calls**: Comprehensive logging
- **Data Events**: S3 and database access
- **7-Year Retention**: ADHICS requirement
- **Log Integrity**: File validation enabled

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "adhics_audit" {
  name = "cortex-emr-adhics-audit"
  
  # Enable for all regions
  is_multi_region_trail = true
  
  # Log file validation for integrity
  enable_log_file_validation = true
  
  # Insight for anomaly detection
  insight_selector {
    insight_type = "ApiCallRateInsight"
  }
}
```

#### GuardDuty for Threat Detection
- **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection
- **Threat Intelligence**: AWS threat feeds
- **Malware Detection**: EBS volume scanning
- **DNS Monitoring**: Malicious domain detection

### 6. Incident Response (ADHICS-IR-01 to IR-05)

**Requirements**:
- Incident response plan
- Automated detection
- Incident classification
- Response procedures
- Post-incident analysis

**Implementation**:

#### Automated Alerting
```hcl
# Security incident alert
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "security_incident" {
  alarm_name = "ADHICS-Security-Incident"
  
  # Multiple failed login attempts
  metric_name = "FailedLoginAttempts"
  threshold   = 5
  
  alarm_actions = [
    aws_sns_topic.security_team.arn,
    aws_sns_topic.compliance_team.arn
  ]
}
```

#### Incident Response Automation

- Configuration monitoring
- Vulnerability management

**Implementation**:

#### AWS Config for Compliance Monitoring
```hcl
# Monitor encryption compliance
resource "aws_config_config_rule" "rds_encrypted" {
  name = "adhics-rds-encryption-check"
  
  source {
    owner             = "AWS"
    source_identifier = "RDS_STORAGE_ENCRYPTED"
  }
}

# Monitor public access
resource "aws_config_config_rule" "no_public_buckets" {
  name = "adhics-s3-public-access-check"
  
  source {
    owner             = "AWS"
    source_identifier = "S3_BUCKET_PUBLIC_ACCESS_PROHIBITED"
  }
}
```
